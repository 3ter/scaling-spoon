I wanted to know if I should open the window on a rainy day to still decrease the relative humidity inside (because the air outside is usually colder than inside where I live and heating it up drops the relative humidity even if fully saturated before).

This utterly simple app (that doesn't even got a proper name after its code name) does the trick for me 🐱‍💻.
